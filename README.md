## Meet HAROLD

**Harold** is not your average HR tool ‚Äî he‚Äôs an **interactive 3D avatar** and a smart assistant powered by **Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit**, designed to revolutionize how we manage HR operations. From scheduling to onboarding, Harold automates it all with personality and precision.

---

## Problem Statement

Human resources kind of got left behind.

While companies push the boundaries in tech and product innovation, internal workflows ‚Äî especially in HR ‚Äî are still plagued by repetitive tasks, manual forms, and outdated tools. Scheduling interviews, coordinating teams, or updating internal processes takes far more time than necessary.

> HR is stuck in slow, clunky, uninspiring systems that waste time and ignore the human experience.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

That‚Äôs why we created **HR3D Agent** ‚Äî and with it, **Harold**.

Harold is our intelligent 3D assistant that transforms traditional HR operations into smooth, automated workflows. Using **Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit**, Harold breaks down complex tasks into intelligent steps, all while interacting through a sleek 3D avatar interface.

> It's like Slack met your HR system‚Ä¶ but with personality and style.
