# üìÉ Contributing Guidelines ‚úèÔ∏è

Welcome! To maintain consistency and ensure a smooth workflow for everyone, please follow the guidelines below.

---


## üìå Workflow

1. **Start from the `develop` branch.**  
   Never work directly on `main`.

2. **Create your own feature branch** using the following naming convention:  `your-stack/your-first-name`.


3. **Commit your changes** to your feature branch using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). See below for syntax.

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your branch into `develop`.

5. **Assign a reviewer**: Choose an available team member for code review.  
Pull requests **must be reviewed** by someone else before merging.

6. **NEVER** open a PR directly to `main`.
